# How to access ALFALFA grids at NRAO

1. Navigate to the [NRAO data archive](https://data.nrao.edu/).

2. Click on the button that says, "View Images" under the blue bar. You must **not** skip this step.

3. In the search bar type "A2010" or "ALFALFA" and press Enter. Alternatively, if you already know which grid you want, you can type its root name e.g. "0004+13", or "1052+23".

4. On the search result row corresponding to the grid that you want, click the little clipboard icon on the far left. It will chane to a green check mark, indicating that it has been added to your download stack, ready to be downloaded.

5. Click the blue "Download" button in the bar just above the search results.

6. If you want all the cubes, weight maps, and continuum files for a particular grid ID, check the box that says, "Include ancillary files" when it pops up. It is usally a good idea to select to receive the data as a single tar file.
